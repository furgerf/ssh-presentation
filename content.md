## Agenda

--

1. What is it?

--

2. Why bother?

--

3. How does it work?

--

3. Configuration

--

4. Usage examples

## Preface

--

- my main takeaway from BSE so far:
  - we are different people... with different areas of knowledge (duh!)

--
- that was the main factor when choosing a topic
  - hopefully there's something interesting for everyone
  - and maybe even something useful as well!

--
- with that in mind:
  - don't hesitate to interrupt and ask if something is unclear

  - adopted as standard by IETF (2006), RFC 4251

#### Measures
]

--
.right-column[
- use non-standard port
  - no real security, but less noise
]

--
.right-column[
- disable password authentication
  - use SSH keys instead
  - (or at least use strong passwords)
]

--
.right-column[
- block hosts with repeated failed logins
  - eg. [fail2ban](http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page)
