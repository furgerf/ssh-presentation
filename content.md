# SSH - Secure SHell

## Agenda

--

1. What is it?

--

2. Why bother?

--

3. How does it work?

--

3. Configuration

--

4. Usage examples

## Preface

--

- my main takeaway from BSE so far:
  - we are different people... with different areas of knowledge (duh!)

--
- that was the main factor when choosing a topic
  - hopefully there's something interesting for everyone
  - and maybe even something useful as well!

--
- with that in mind:
  - don't hesitate to interrupt and ask if something is unclear

.right-column[

  - either use automatically-generated key pair for encryption and password for authentication

- TODO: crypto hs, conn encrypted with symmetric cipher, client authenticates
]

--
.right-column[
- authentication methods:
  - GSSAPI-based, host-based, **public key**, challenge-response, password
  - public key: grant access when public key in `~/.ssh/authorized_hosts` belongs to user/host TODO there's something missing here
  - password transmission is safe because communication is encrypted
]
???
Host-based: grant access if host is listed in `/etc/hosts.equiv` (or one of a few other files), the
username matches, and the key in `known_hosts` matches. This is inherently insecure.
challenge-response: server sends Qq and expects response (eg. Bx or PAM).

.right-column[
- `ssh` maintains `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file to avoid MITM attacks

#### Measures

.right-column[
- use non-standard port
  - no real security, but less noise
]

--
.right-column[
- disable password authentication
  - use SSH keys instead
  - (or at least use strong passwords)
]

--
.right-column[
- block hosts with repeated failed logins

uses `gzip` - recommended for slow networks only

has security and performance implications

listens on the local address and forwards all connections to the address
unix sockets can be forwarded as well

--

- `-f`: fork to background, recommended when using X11-forwarding
]
???
implies `-n` (stdin > /dev/null)

]

---
.right-column[
- `-i identity_file`: specify public key to use for authentication
]

--
.right-column[
- `-J [user@]host[:port]`: use a jump host and establish forwarding to destination from there
]
???
Demo
TODO: TEST THIS!

--

useful when just wanting to forward ports
