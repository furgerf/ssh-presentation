# SSH - Secure SHell

## Agenda

--

1. What is it?

--

2. Why bother?

--

3. How does it work?

--

3. Configuration

--

4. Usage examples

## Preface

--

- my main takeaway from BSE so far:
  - we are different people... with different areas of knowledge (duh!)

--
- that was the main factor when choosing a topic
  - hopefully there's something interesting for everyone
  - and maybe even something useful as well!

--
- with that in mind:
  - don't hesitate to interrupt and ask if something is unclear

  ### Connection
]

---
.right-column[
- server sends its public host key
]

--
.right-column[
- establish encryption: session key negotiation (Diffie-Hellman)
]
???
Diffie-Hellman:
- both agree on large prime number and encryption generator (like AES)
- both generate secret prime number (private key) and generate public key with the private key, encryption generator and the shared prime number
- the public keys are exchanged
- both calculate the shared session key from the own private key, the other's public key, and the original shared prime number

--
.right-column[
- authenticate user
  - based on GSSAPI, host, **public key**, challenge-response, or _password_
]
???
Host-based: grant access if host is listed in `/etc/hosts.equiv` (or one of a few other files), the
username matches, and the key in `known_hosts` matches. This is inherently insecure.

Challenge-response: server sends Qq and expects response (eg. Bx or PAM).

.right-column[
- `ssh` maintains `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file to avoid MITM attacks
- TODO: Move to other slide

#### Measures
]

.right-column[
- use non-standard port
  - no real security, but less noise
]

--
.right-column[
- disable password authentication
  - use SSH keys instead
  - (or at least use strong passwords)
]

--
.right-column[
- block hosts with repeated failed logins

.right-column[
- `-C`: enable compression
]
???
uses `gzip` - recommended for slow networks only

.right-column[

has security and performance implications

--
.right-column[
- `-D [bind_address:]port`: dynamic port forwarding
]

listens on the local address and forwards all connections to the address
unix sockets can be forwarded as well

--
.right-column[
- `-f`: fork to background, recommended when using X11-forwarding
]
???
implies `-n` (stdin > /dev/null)

--
.right-column[
- `-g`: allow remote hosts to connect to local forwarded ports
]

---
.right-column[
- `-i identity_file`: specify public key to use for authentication
]

--
.right-column[
- `-J [user@]host[:port]`: use a jump host and establish forwarding to destination from there
]
???
Demo
TODO: TEST THIS!

--
.right-column[

]
???
unix sockets can be forwarded as well

--
.right-column[
- `-N`: no remote command execution
]
???
useful when just wanting to forward ports

---
.right-column[
