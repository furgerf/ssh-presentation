## Preface

--

- my main takeaway from BSE so far:
  - we are different people... with different areas of knowledge (duh!)

--
- that was the main factor when choosing a topic
  - hopefully there's something interesting for everyone
  - and maybe even something useful as well!

--
- with that in mind:
  - don't hesitate to interrupt and ask if something is unclear

]

--
.right-column[

--

]
???
To be demonstrated later

--

Available on pretty much all platforms, mobile, browser

**Demo**: Show FireSSH plugin to login on raspi (using stored session)

  ### Connection

---
.right-column[
- server sends its public fingerprint
]

--
.right-column[
- up to the user to verify the server fingerprint:
  - get from sysadmin
  - initial connection from trusted network
  - hope it's ok
]

--
.right-column[
- establish encryption: session key negotiation (Diffie-Hellman)
]
???
Diffie-Hellman:
- both agree on large prime number and encryption generator (like AES)
- both generate secret prime number (private key) and generate public key with the private key, encryption generator and the shared prime number
- the public keys are exchanged
- both calculate the shared session key from the own private key, the other's public key, and the original shared prime number

--
.right-column[
- authenticate user
  - based on GSSAPI, host, **public key**, challenge-response, or _password_
]
???
Host-based: grant access if host is listed in `/etc/hosts.equiv` (or one of a few other files), the
username matches, and the key in `known_hosts` matches. This is inherently insecure.

Challenge-response: server sends Qq and expects response (eg. Bx or PAM).

#### Measures
]

--
.right-column[
- disable password authentication
  - use SSH keys instead
  - (or at least use strong passwords)
]

--
.right-column[
- use non-standard port
  - no real security, but less noise
]

--
.right-column[
- block hosts with repeated failed logins

.right-column[
- user configuration
  - `~/.ssh/config`
]
???
**Demo**

`ssh [raspiuser]@[raspihost]` [Show user config] `ssh raspi`

Because already logged in, show login attempts on raspi (attack surface!):

`journalctl --unit=sshd -r --no-pager | grep -i invalid`

--
.right-column[
- system-wide configuration
  - `/etc/ssh/ssh_config`
  - `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
]
???
Configure stuff like:
```
PasswordAuthentication, PubkeyAuthentication,
HostBased, ChallengeResponse, KeyboardInteractive
AllowGroups, AllowUsers, DenyGroups, DenyUsers
X11Forwarding
PermitTunnel
PermintUserEnvironment

Match user <username>
ForceCommand <command>
```

**Demo:** MatchUser and ForceCommand

Show `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` on raspi and login as `dummy` user

--
.right-column[
- keys
  - `~/.ssh/known_hosts`
  - `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
  - `~/.ssh/id_rsa{,.pub}`

???
**Demo** `ssh -v raspi` (maybe), swap IP/key in `~/.ssh/known_hosts` and log in again

Permissions:
- `~/.ssh`: 700
- public keys: 644
- private keys: 600

### Common options
- `-i identity_file`: specify key for authentication
- `-X`: enable X11 forwarding
- `-p port`: specify port on remote host
- `-C`: enable compression
- `-c cipher`: specify cipher
]
???
Compression uses `gzip` - recommended for slow networks only

Cipher has security and performance implications

### Tunnelling
- secure insecure protocol
- make remote service appear local
- some options:
  - `-L [address:]port:host:hostport`: forward connections to the local host to the remote host/port
  - `-f`: fork to background, recommended when using X11-forwarding
  - `-N`: no remote command execution
  - `-g`: allow remote hosts to connect to local forwarded ports
]
???
**Demo**: access localhost mongodb
```
ssh -f -N -L 12345:localhost:27017 hxm@cdaip
mongo localhost:12345/fatigue
```

Also: `-R` (reverse proxy), `-D`- (dynamic port forwarding)

Unix sockets can be forwarded as well

`-f`: implies `-n` (stdin > /dev/null)

`-N`: Useful when just wanting to forward ports
